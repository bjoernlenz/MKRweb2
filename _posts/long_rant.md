## This is a long rant

I am ranting... and testing to see how well Telegram's
"read more" feature works... so... let's see how well it works.

Yay!

Telegram supports [GitHub](https://github.com) as well as [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com)
as backing store for Telegram site.

After you sign up with Telegram, you will have the option to link your Telegram 
account with your GitHub account via a blue button on the bottom of the Telegram home
page.

When you link your Telegram account with your GitHub account, Telegram will add a unique
SSH public key to your GitHub account.  Telegram uses this SSH key to read your GitHub repositories.

You can create a new Telegram site on GitHub by forking the [my-blog](https://github.com/telegr-am/my-blog)
sample site which contains a Home page, and About page, and a sample blog post.

GitHub support is generally better for larger sites as it's more efficient to get the
contents of a GitHub repository.

Next up in GitHub support is automatically adding a service hook so that Telegram will automatically
publish your site when you push to your repository.

Enjoy!
